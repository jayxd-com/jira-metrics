# sprintReport

This file will generate sprint active/close data using the existing Google Sheet. It is not linked with the direct API. 
You might need to adjust code for it.

This is 90% done because everytime we run file, it refreshes data and upon my further testing it wasn't preserving the active data when updating closed columns. 
I tried to do it without refreshing/recreating the file but program gets lost what cells needs to be updated because it is dynamic.

However, I have provided enough code as boilerplate that will give you an idea how it is being done. 

I have also styled the sheet to make it look nice. Again, this will give you an idea how to manage or style the sheet.

To make it 100% work my end, I need to use API and test it to get the desired results. As you know, it will include trial and error, debugging etc as well.

TIP: If you are confused and need code explaination. Feed my code to chatGPT and it will explain. I can explain it too if you are interested. I don't mind.
